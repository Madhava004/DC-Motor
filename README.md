## Working of a DC motor
The operation of a DC motor is based on the principle that when a current carrying conductor is placed 
in a magnetic field, a mechanical force is experienced by it. The direction of this force is determined 
by Fleming’s Left Hand Rule and its magnitude is given by the relation: 

                                                         F = Bil Newton

For simplicity, consider only one coil of the armature placed in the magnetic field produced by a bipolar 
machine(a). When DC supply is connected to the coil, current flows through it which sets up its own 
field as shown in Figure(b). By the interaction of the two fields (i.e., field produced by the main poles 
and the coil), a resultant field is set up as shown in figure (c). The tendency of this is to come to its 
original position i.e., in straight line due to which force is exerted on the two coil sides and torque 
develops which rotates the coil.

Alternately, it can be said that the main poles produce a field Fm. Its direction is marked in below Fig. 
When current is supplied to the coil (armature conductors), it makes its field marked as Fr. This field 
tries to come in line with the main field and an electromagnetic torque develops in a clockwise 
direction as marked in below figure (a). In an actual machine, many conductors are placed on the 
armature. All the conductors, placed under the influence of one pole (say, the North pole) carry the 
current in one direction (outward). Whereas, the other conductors placed under the influence of the 
other pole, i.e., the south pole, carry the current in opposite direction as shown in figure (b) below. A 
resultant rotor field is produced. The arrow-head Fr marks its direction. This rotor field Fr tries to come 
in line with the main field Fm and torque (Te) develops. Thus, rotor rotates.

It has been seen that when current is supplied to the armature conductors, as shown in Fig.(a), placed 
in the main magnetic field, torque develops and armature rotates. Simultaneously, the armature 
conductors cut across the magnetic field and an emf is induced in these conductors.This induced emf 
is known as back emf. The direction of this induced emf in the armature conductors is determined by 
Fleming’s Right Hand Rule and is marked in Fig. (b)
